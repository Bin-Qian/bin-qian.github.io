Hi, I am a postgraduate research student with the school of computing, Newcastle University.
My research focus on the edge-cloud collaboration, ditributed learning, task offloading. 
In am currently under the supervision of Prof. Rajiv Ranjan, School of Computing, Newcastle University and Prof. Zhenyu Wen, Institue of Cyberspace security, Zhejiang University of Technology.
Prior to that, I received Msc Data Science with distinction 2018, University of Southampton, supervised by Prof. Katayoun (Kate) Farrahi.
